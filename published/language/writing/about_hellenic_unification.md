I no longer believe in unifying greek, cyrillic, and latin scripts in any
capacity - whether on keyboards or in codepoints. The problems of this system
are small, and any solution would necessarily introduce new problems.

Most importantly, solutions face big hurdles. It's hard to handle when uppercase
letters are the same, but lower case are totally different, particularly across
all 3 languages. There's also lots of somewhat similar letters that may or may
not be confusing, depending on the reader.

Instead, I heavily support extending the latin alphabet to include more symbols,
including greek letters that are already widely known, like delta, and in
particular pi. This means practically expanding the alphabet, but also putting
keys on keyboards to type any new letters.

I support extending the latin alphabet for many other reasons, too! But
extending the latin alphabet needs 1 alphabet to change -- a much easier task
than changing 3. And changing 1 alphabet means that the histories and cultures
of the other 2 can be ignored, which makes this an even simpler task.

I also support limiting the use of the greek alphabet to only use unambiguous
letters, like the way cyrillic does on its russian license plates. It's become
very apparent that most people can't pronounce omicron, let alone distinguish it
from the letter o. Using it at all is inappropriate -- it should be avoided in
and dropped from science and math in its entirety (something most authors do
recognize).
