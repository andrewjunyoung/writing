The star spangled banner

O say can you see
by the dawn's early light
what so gallantly we held
at the twilight's last gleaming

...

And the rocket's red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave groof through the naight
that our flag was still there

O say can you see
that star spangled banner yet wave
o'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave
