# Ideas from «extreme programming»
- After the customer or user chooses 3 of the 4 factors -- cost; schedule; features; and quality -- the software developers get to choose the fourth
- A representative of the user community to reside within the software project team during development

# Interviews with software devs
## About things that define success
- The product worked the way it was suposed to work 
- Developing the project had been a technical challenge (lots of data shows that, most of all, technologists really like overcoming a tough problem) 
- The team was small and high performing 
- Management was «the best i've ever worked with» Why? «because the team was given the freedom to develop a good design»; because there was no «scope creep»; and because «i never felt pressure from the schedule»..

## About why their projects were late
- The schedule estimates were unrealistic 
- There was lack of resources, particularly expect advice 
- Scope was poorly understood at the outset 
- The project started late.

# Projects where no estimates were prepped at all frared best on productivity; Laundsbaum and Glass (1992) found « a very strong correlation between lvel of productivity ad a feeling of control »

# NASA found that 70 % of its programs can be built from re-used modules

# Many advocate the use of particularly skilled, expert generalizers

# It is almost always a mistake to modify packaged, vendor-produced software systems

# Design patterns emerge from practice, not from theory.


# About complexity
- People are important because it takes considerable intelligence and skill to overcome complexity
- Design is seldom optimized because optimization is nearly impossible in the face of significant complexity
- 100 % test coverage is impossible, but also insufficient, because of the enormous number of paths in most programs, and because software complexity leads to errors that coverage cannot trap
- Understanding the existing product is one of the hardest tasks of software maintenance because there are so many possible correct solution approaches to solving any one problem
- Software has so many errors because it's so difficult to get right the first time

# About product reviews
- Kerth (2001) claims 3 ~ 12 months after delivery is the best time to review what happened
- Don't let managers attend reviews if they review the producer rather than the product. Don't permit unprepared attendees to participate. Separate the review leader role from the producer role (to diminish ego involvement of the producer). Hard-won sociological lessons are embedded in the rules for most formal reviews. And informal review approaches had better look out for those same problems.
- Declare an open refrigerator policy during the review. Hunger is bad !
- Give people off-ramps. For code, this means being able to discreetly make changes with no loss of face

# Old hardware becomes obsolete; old software goes into production every night.

# The 60 / 60 rule
60 % of software's dollar is spent on maintenance, and 60 % of that maintenance is enhancement. 
Enhancing old software is therefore a big deal.
