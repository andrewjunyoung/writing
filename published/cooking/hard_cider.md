## Foreword

This is my first time brewing hard cider. I've previously brewed 3 batches honey mead, with 3 different results.

Some FAQs about brewing alcohol --
1. No this won't make you go blind. That's only a (minor) risk if you distill your own alcohol. Hard cider is made through fermentation, and so there's no risk. The worst that'll happen is that you feel slightly unwell, temporarily.
2. The whole process will take as long as you want, from as little as 1 month to as much as 6 months.

## Equipment:
  - A hermetically sealed (air-tight) jar
  - Bleach (for sanitization)
  - A big pot
  - Either a ladle, siphon, or self-confidence and some paper towel

## Ingredients:
- Apple cider, 1 gallon (AKA «cloudy apple juice») 
- Yeast (I used Fleischman's)
- Brown sugar, > 2 tablespoons
- Ingredients to taste. Some ingredients that I tried (which I'll update with my thoughts & conclusions):
    - maple syrup
    - honey
    - peppercorns
    - tea embryo (ZH: 胎菊, táijú)
    - thyme
    - brown sugar
    - apple slices
    - cinnamon

## Method:
### On day 1
1. *Sanitize your Equipment*: Before you begin, it's crucial to sanitize all of your equipment to prevent any unwanted bacteria from contaminating your cider. Use a mixture of hot water and bleach to sanitize *anything that comes into contact with your mixture* -- your hermetically sealed jar, pot, and your ladle or siphon. Make sure to rinse thoroughly afterward with hot water to avoid any bleach residue.

1. *Boil the Apple Cider*: Pour 3/4 gallon of apple cider into your sanitized cooking pot, and put it on medium heat. Cool enough that it won't boil, but hot enough that it will warm up.

1. *Add ingredients to taste*: Add at least 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Add any other flavors you want to add to your batch, to taste. Remember, the sugar is a snack for the yeast. They have a long journey ahead of them -- do not skip this just because *you* don't want sugar. It's not for you. 

1. *Pour the mead into the jar*

1. *Add the remaining 1/4 gallon of apple cider to the jar*

1. *Wait for the mixture to cool to 30 C (= 90 F)*

1. *Add the yeast*: Sprinkle the yeast over the apple cider inside the jar. For 1 gallon, you should use about 1 pack of yeast.

1. *Fermentation*: Seal the jar tightly to prevent any air from entering. Place the jar in a cool, dark place where it can ferment undisturbed.

1. *Monitor the Fermentation*: Check on the cider periodically to monitor its progress. You should start to see bubbles forming in the cider, indicating that fermentation is taking place. If you don't see this, your yeast may be dead. Maybe because you were impatient about allowing your cider to cool down; or maybe because you need to buy new yeast. If you really see no bubbling after about an hour or two (your jar should also produce some heat from the yeast), then things aren't looking good.

Now you wait. The first process typically takes around 1-2 weeks, but it can vary depending on various factors such as temperature and yeast activity.
### After 2 weeks

1. *Taste Testing*: After about a week, you can start tasting the cider to see if it has reached your desired level of fermentation. Keep in mind that the longer you let it ferment, the drier and stronger the cider will become. Once it reaches your preferred taste, you can move on to the next step.

1. *Bottling*: Once fermentation is complete, it's time to bottle your cider. Use sanitized bottles and a siphon or ladle to transfer the cider from the jar into the bottles. Leave a little bit of headspace at the top of each bottle to allow for carbonation.

1. *Carbonation (Optional)*: If you prefer carbonated cider, you can add a small amount of priming sugar to each bottle before sealing them. This will create carbonation as the remaining yeast in the cider consumes the sugar. Alternatively, you can skip this step if you prefer still cider.

1. *Aging (Optional)*: While the cider is technically ready to drink at this point, you can choose to let it age for a few weeks or even months to allow the flavors to mellow and develop further. Store the bottles in a cool, dark place during this time.

1. *Enjoy*: Once the cider has aged to your liking, it's time to enjoy the fruits of your labor! Chill the cider in the refrigerator before serving, and pour it into glasses to savor its delicious flavor.
