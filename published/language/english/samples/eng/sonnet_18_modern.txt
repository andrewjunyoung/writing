Shall i compare you to a summer's day?
You are more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,
And summer's lease has all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;
But your eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair you owe;
Nor shall death brag you wander in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time you grow.
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to you.
