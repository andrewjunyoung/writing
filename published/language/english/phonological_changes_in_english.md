This document is designed to keep track of some of the most common sound changes
happening in modern english, and remind people that these sound changes are
common and have planty of historical analogs!

Sound changes happen all the time, some far more common than others.

This project intends to show that, to track the ways in which english is
changing under our noses, and to make historical linguistic comparisons to
understand where english might go from here.

I also consider this to be a useful document for world building and prediction
for other languages - by understanding how common different language shifts are,
we can simulate these changes better ourselves.
