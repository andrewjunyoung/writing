# Translating «kasaneru» (重ねる)

重ねる。物事が積み上がったまま。または、多くの物事が一緒に総合のものになるさま。

Concatenate: originally meaning to string end to end, or stick together. I feel
this best captures the sound, spirit, and direct meaning of «kasaneru».

Why this word? For one, the /k/ at the front of «concatenate» instantly gives it
the same vocal quality as the /k/ that begins «kasaneru».

Beyond this, the 2 words do contain similar visual meaning. When i picture
somebody stacking books (本を重ねる), my mind stacks these object as a moving
mental image, like hands being placed on top of each other. When i hear
«concatenate», i picture a sideways line of objects being appended to each
other.

These words feel like the asme idea in different orientations, just as
they appear in 2 different languages. Most of all, each of these words forces
the listener to consider the objects in play, and the wholeness that a group of
objects are together. Like when I concatenate an experience to my life, this
metaphysical addition to the whole is mirrored by «kasaneru» -- both the
physical and metaphysical translations are true to the original words.

And in this light, reflect on using «concatenate» in english. It's by no means
common vocabulary.

But a whole field of experiences concatenate in our lives: memories;
experiences; and the ways of expressing ourselves, we add to our toolkit of
learned ideas.

I find this word addictive. Once i see parts of my life as sticking onto some
bigger picture, i see it more and more.

We should spare room in our vocab for a word which describes this heritage we
take with us, whenever new me may go.

The old and the new, concatenated together -- not alone, but something new and
whole that would be fundamentally different without all its parts.
