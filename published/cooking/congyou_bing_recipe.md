Your dough should have 9 layers now.

1. Add to a pan which has been oiled (_very_ lightly) with veg oil. You've
   probably used enough by now and are possibly worried for your health.
1. Cook for around 4~5 minutes on medium heat, ensuring it cooks through, and
   flipping in between
1. Serve with oyster sauce (I used water to dilute mine as the taste is quite
   intense on its own)
