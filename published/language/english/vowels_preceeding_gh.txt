I notice that there are no vowels preceding «gh» that aren't dipthongs. The
permitted syllables with «gh» appear to follow the below pattern:

(C) (C) (C) V gh (t)

The postfixed consonant, if there is one, must be /t/, and the preceeding vowel
must be a dipthong. Hence the word «streight» is an example of a morphologically
valid word.

The permitted vowels (all of which are dipthongs) are:

- ai (straight)
- i (high)
- ei (weigh)
- ou (ought)
- au (laugh)

«i» must always be pronounced /ai/ in this position; «ou» is pronounced /o/;
«au» is pronounced /a/ (perhaps through evolution?).

This applies to native english word, and is broken by loanwords, for example
shillelagh (/ʃɪˈleɪlə/ shi-LAY-lə) from irish. Whether these words were ever
pronounced with «gh» as /x/ is unknown to me.
