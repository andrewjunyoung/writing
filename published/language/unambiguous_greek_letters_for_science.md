# Unambiguous greek letters for science

There's a huge problem that the greek alphabet contains lots of letters which
look identical to, or nearly identical to, their latin letter counterparts. This
makes communicating science hard, in newspapers and in classrooms, and creates 
confusion from people when reading.

Just as Russian vehicle registration places use a subset of the russian alphabet
that overlaps with the latin alphabet (to avoid confusion), science should only
use greek letters which are distinct enough from their latin counterparts.

This is already somewhat the case, but organizations that name things with greek
letters still use letters that create confusion.

For example, recent events have highlighted that most people can't pronounce
omicron, let alone distinguish it from the letter o. Using it at all is
inappropriate -- it should be avoided in and dropped from science and math in
its entirety (something most authors do recognize).

Below is a quick analysis of which greek letters should be used:
