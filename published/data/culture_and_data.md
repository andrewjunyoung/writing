A lot of data is collected in the modern world, by reporters, writers and such.

If you look at these graphs, you realize that most graphs look the same --
Europe and east Asia are one color gradient, and the rest of the world is in
another color.

Sometimes South Africa is that primary color. Sometimes latin america joins the
party, although probably with a less bold tone of the color.

Africa doesn't have the color. Sometimes China and Russia have a pale version of
the color. North Korea is marked as "no data".

All these graphs are made by asking questions that matter to the people that
make them:
- how rich is a country?
- how much do they produce?
- how democratic is it?
- how much do they align with the beliefs of the graph maker?

This is yet again Mark Twain's «To the person living in darkness», back with a
vengeance.

This isnt a malicious act (generally the opposite -- curious envquiry from the
graph maker). But when you have organizations like Our World in Data, or the New
York Times, or Pew Research, made up of the same western college educated,
outwardly homogenous people, you get the same questions asked -- the ones that
matter to them.

So whether it's about vaccinations or the environment, about democracy or crime,
every graph looks the same. Even in a world with more nuance than coloring a 
country one color.
