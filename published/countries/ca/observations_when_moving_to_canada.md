# Canada (general)
- No rules about size of coins.
- The currency _is_ in size order, with the sole exception of nickels being
  bigger than dimes.
- 99 % mask compliance at the airports - higher than the UK in any contexts (for
  which I have no data). I only saw one person who was non-compliant - and they
  did have a mask on them, they just had it down while they rested.
- Farms here are _way_ bigger than in the UK. By roughly factor 5.
- The Chinese names of Canadian cities often come from dialects - in particular,
  I'm guessing, hokkien and cantonese. They contain final consonants and
  different vowel structures, so words like «渥太华» (wotàihuá) become «otawa» -
  which is actually a good phonetic approximation.

# Montreal
- Lol @ the size of english in some (Starbucks) bilingual signs
- Some cool code mixing. Also people who would talk to english to one person
  _while_ talking to another person in french, right next to them.

  A <-- French --> B <-- English --> C

- /t/ → /ts/, /s/ seems to be ubiquitous among french speakers. I didn't hear
  cases of isolated /t/ at all in montreal. So «constitution» would be
  (roughly) /kãũssisysjãũ/. To give a real example I noticed, «ceinture» sounded
  the same as «censure». «Apperitif» sounded like /apɛritsif/ to me.
- Long / short vowel contrast (maybe plus other factors) in quebec french make it
  sound a lot like italian and other, more melodic romance languages.

# Montreal → Ottawa
- The sparsely occupied farmland doesn't really end between these two cities.
  But MY GOD is there a lot of forest.
- Absolutely beautiful landscape. I'm not an environmentalist in the UK, but
  seeing Canada makes me feel emotional, and want to preserve and protect it in
  a way that I don't feel for anywhere in Britain.
## Lots of forest
  - There is A LOT of it. It's usually pretty geometrically carved out of
  farmlands, but every now and then you'll see a chunk of forest that
  stretches for miles, through lakes and mountains. When you find those
  forests, you can just about imagine what Canada would have been like to some
  of the first europeans settling or exploring it - vast forestland, with a
  few lakes.
  - Beavers turned everything from swamp to forest. Go beavers.
## Ottawa
  - About 1 / 5 houses has a back-garden pool. (Compared with 0 % in London)
  - The height of urban buildings stands out in the predominantly rural
  landscape. Contrast with the UK, which has very few tall buildings anywhere,
  even in the capital. Even non-major towns near Ottawa had a couple of
  noticeably tall buildings.
