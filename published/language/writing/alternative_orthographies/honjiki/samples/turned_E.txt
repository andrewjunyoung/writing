Ǝ ǝ or turned E is an additional letter of the Latin alphabet used in African
languages using the Pan-Nigerian alphabet or the African reference alphabet. The
minuscule is based on a rotated e and the capital form majuscule Ǝ, based on a
rotated majuscule E.

It is not to be confused with U+2203 ∃ THERE EXISTS, the existential quantifier
used in logic, or with U+0259 ə LATIN SMALL LETTER SCHWA (uppercase Ə), which is
used as a phonetic symbol and as a letter in languages of the Caucasus (such as
Azerbaijani). In MacOS with the U.S. Extended keyboard, the letter Ǝ is made
with ⌥ Opt+⇧ Shift+: followed by E

The additional letter was popularized when it was used in the name of American
rapper Eminem, which is styled as EMINƎM since The Marshall Mathers LP was
released in 2000.
